#Python#
Python is space sensitive!

Virtual Environment will isolate your Python/Django setup on a per-project basis. This means that any changes you make to one website won't affect any others you're also developing.

Trailing commas in lists in Python are always a good habit. We know this goes against everything you learned in JavaScript, but we promise it's alright here in Python land!

###How to write a function:###
```python
def functionName(arguments):
    #always indent 4 spaces in Python
    #write your function or define variables inside the function declaration
    return  #return ends the function
```

###Importing packages:###
Example:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse #from package.subpackage import module 

def hello_world(request):
  return HttpResponse('Hello World')
```

#Django#
Django is a MTV(Model-Template-View) framework. MTV is similar to what we've seen with MVC in Ruby on Rails except for some small differences. For instance, Views in Django are the bridge between Models(Database) and Templates(What You See), similar to what we called Controllers in Ruby on Rails.

Routes in Django are written using regular expressions

###How to start a project in Django:###
First you need Django installed. You can do that by running
`pip install django`
You can then enter
`django-admin.py startproject project_name ` or `django-admin startproject project_name`
to create a project tree directory. This directory will have certain files/directories in it now, including the: <br>
* project_name root directory - project's root folder<br>
<br>
Inside of that is:<br>
<br>
* manage.py - "Django Admin" used to run commands for project. Similar to app.js in node or App.js in React<br>
* project_name directory stub - holds: <br> 
    * settings.py - settings are stored here<br>
    * urls.py - holds base URLs for our project
    * wsgi.py - controls how project is served at places like Heroku. The entry point from our web server.

###Running the Server:###
From within the project_name directory, not the root directory, run: 
`python manage.py migrate`

This will apply all pending migrations from all apps. Migrations, as we know, are all about the database, which we haven't set up. That's because Django comes with one. Then, run:
`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
This will run the server.

###How to Write a URL:###
URLs are all written in your urls.py file.

In our urls.py we have to import from what view it is we're using for our route. For example, if we had a views.py file in the same directory as your urls.py we'd write this line:
```python
from . import views
```
Then we'd add what specific "view"(function) it is that we want to load to the url route we specify using regular expressions. So if we had a `hello_world` function in our views.py we could also add this line in our urls.py:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.hello_world) #first: route written in regular expression(this example is a blank string, aka the root), second: the view you're rendering on that route
]
```

###How to Create an App:###
Django projects contain multiple Django apps. Each app generally encompasses a specific area of functionality.

To create an app in Django run this command in your terminal:
`python manage.py startapp app_name`

After we run that command, go into your projects settings.py file and find the part that has the array `INSTALLED_APPS`. After all of the django apps already included in the array, make sure to add whatever you `app_name` was you used in the command `python manage.py startapp app_name`.

###How to Create a Model for your App:###
Just like in Ruby on Rails, in Django, Models are singular.

In the models.py file of our newly created app we'll include this code:
```python
class WhateverIsTheSingularOfYourApp(models.Model): #Our class here will inherit from the base class models.Model because we're making it a Model. (models.Model) is the base class that our models are going to extend.
    created\_at = models.DateTimeField(auto\_now\_add=True) #To add columns to our table we add attributes to our class
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
```
